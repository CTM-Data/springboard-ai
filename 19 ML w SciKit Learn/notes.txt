	grouped by function
		regression - model a relationship between variables
		instance-based - compare new problems or data to previously-seen data in order to classify
		regularization - usually related to reducing overfitting and improving a model's ability to generalize
		decision trees - run a new data point through a tree that uses forks until a prediction is made 
		bayesian algos - estimate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge 
		clustering algorithms - methods to group parts of data together by maxiumum commonality 
		association rule learning algorithms - extract rules that explains observed relationships, often end up in an "if-then" format, where "then" is the outcome
		artifical neural networks - pattern matching meant to emulate the a biological neural network
		deep learning algorithms - build much larger and more complex neural networks 
		dimensionality reduction algorithms -
