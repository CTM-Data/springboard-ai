algorithm: set of steps for computer to accomplish a task

algos are analyzed for correctness and efficiency

you can create new algos! there are so many applications

harnesses massive computational power to do interesting and useful things


what makes a good algo? 
	solves a problem
	compute it efficiently 
		how do you measure it efficiently? 
		runtime is no good, b/c its context dependent: that computer, that input, etc. 
		can't extrapolate beyond
