Recurrant Neural Networks
	order matters
	recurrant basically means you feed into an input to get out output, adn then that output is combined wieth another input to form another output, and so on
	the data from "earlier" recur throughout the process. 

Long Short Term Memory
	cell state; keeps context over a longer period
