Aim: 
	predict where a Crypto currency is will be up or down tomorrow.
	explain the reasoning using AI interpretability
Data: 
	open/high/low/close/volume data via crypto apis
		CoinCap API free tier
	on-chain metrics
		block chair
		blockcypher
		mempool.space
		coinbase?
	sentiment data from reddit, twitter, or other source
		reddit api
		newsAPI
		tweepy? for twitter
	
Models:
	logistic regression as a baseline
	random forest or xgboost? 
	maybe a third, possibly a transformer? 
	explainability: SHAP (most likely), LIME (also possible)
	
Evaluation:
	accuracy, precision, recall, f1
	roc auc
	confusion matrix
	backtest how my the recommendations would have performed in different markets (bull/bear/sideways)

Deliverable:
	[stretch] streamlit or deepnote real-time app, refreshes every minute, gives recommendation. includes reason
	notebook or similar showing the results of the analysis, but maybe not interactive
