4 areas of focus
	(1/2) data focused engineer* - OPINION: very much the most common type of models that are needed in govt contracting, etc
		data is the star of the show
		focus on handling large amounts of data efficiently
		focus on fully automated ingestion solutions
		improving model performance by improving data quality: lots of preprocessing, acquisition, cleaning
	(1/2) model-focused engineer*
		model is the star of the show
		feature engineering: picking the right model, fine-tuning it using diff parameters, avoiding overfitting, etc
		not just using out of box solutions: new ones or stacking/combining existing techniques
		really getting into the weeds from a model-selection standpoint
	(3) architecture-focused engineer
		engineering and software architecture are the stars of the show
		custom cloud solution to house the application
		solution will be enterprise-like, complete with developer-oriented documentation
	(4) product-driven engineer	
		product/app is the star of the show
		be able to show how it works to anyone
		have a website that shows off the product

stick to particular areas of ml
	they recommend deep learning applications, specifically NLP or computer vision
	if a student does a more "traditional" model (regression, random forests, etc), they recommend beefing up the engieering and deployment side so that the project is rigorous enough
