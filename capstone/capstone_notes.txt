4 areas of focus
	data focused engineer - OPINION: very much the most common type of models that are needed in govt contracting, etc
		data is the star of the show
		focus on handling large amounts of data efficiently
		focus on fully automated ingestion solutions
		improving model performance by improving data quality: lots of preprocessing, acquisition, cleaning
	model-focused engineer*
		model is the star of the show
		feature engineering: picking the right model, fine-tuning it using diff parameters, avoiding overfitting, etc
		not just using out of box solutions: new ones or stacking/combining existing techniques
		really getting into the weeds from a model-selection standpoint
	architecture-focused engineer*
	product-driven engineer
