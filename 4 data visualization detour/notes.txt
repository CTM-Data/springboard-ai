4 data visualization detour

VISUALIZING DISTRIBUTIONS
	Data camp course CH 1	
		Categorical (e.g. eye color) vs continuous (height in cm)
		histograms: modality of a distribution: unimodal, bimodal, trimodel. modality = number of peaks
		histograms: loook at the skewness of the distribution. left skew = extreme values on the left
		histograms: kurtosis (occurance of extreme values):
			leptokurtic: few extreme values, many occurances in middle value 
			mesokurtic: typical bell curve
			platykurtic: many extreme values make the distro look more like a hump than a bell curve
		box plot: use when a continous variable (age) is split by category (occupation)
	Data camp course CH 2

	Logarithms
		converts multiplication and division into additiona and subtraction
		14 x 12: log14 + log12 = 2.2253. what number has a log of that? 168.
		log (2) of 8 = 3: this means "2 to the 3rd power yields 8"
		very small and very large numbers are made much easier to work with using logs
		logs are just exponents. powers. 
		logs are exponents backwards
	Scatterplots
		used to show relationships between two variables. 
		x axis = independent
		y = dependent
		how to tell? 
		should be used when you have two continous varibles.
