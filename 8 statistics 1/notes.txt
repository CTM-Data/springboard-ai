STATISTICS 
	variables
		quantitative vs categorical
		categorical can have two types: ordinal (ordered e.g. letter grades in school) and nominal (non-ordered, e.g. nfl team preference)
		quantitative can have two types: discrete (e.g. the numbers of times I've run this week) vs continuous (any numerical values)
	population v sample
		population: N (case sensitive)
		sample: n (case sensitive)
	measures of spread
		interquartile range: spread of the middle 50%
		range: largest value - smallest value 
		variance: calculate each point's difference from the mean/ number od data points
		sample variance, if calculated like above, would always be a little smaller than the population variance: divide by number of samples - 1 to get proper number
