complexity analysis
	how much TIME does an algo need? 
	how much COMPUTATION does an algo need? 
	Big-0 notation: gives upper bound of complexity in the worst case
	you can notate time complexity and computation complexity using Big-0

queues priority queues (min and max heaps)

	ruskal's algorithm
	other operations
