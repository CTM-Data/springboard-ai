	first normal form violation: repeating group of data
	second normal form: each attribute (column) of a table must be entirely depending all of the primary key
	third normal form: no transitive dependencies. dependence of non-key attribute on another non-key attribute
	in many cases, once you get to third normal form you have fully normalized the database
