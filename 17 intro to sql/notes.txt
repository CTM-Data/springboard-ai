subquery in sql
	subqueries are typically passed in the WHERE clause
database normalization
	first normal form to fifth normal form
	first is most risky, fifth is most safe
	normalization
	first normal form violation: row order should never convey information in and of itself
	first normal form violation: mixing data types
	first normal form violation: not having primary keys
	first normal form violation: repeating group of data
	second normal form: each attribute (column) of a table must be entirely depending all of the primary key
	third normal form: no transitive dependencies. dependence of non-key attribute on another non-key attribute
	fourth normal form: multivalue relationships can only depend on the key, not on another column
	fifth normal form: if a table can be logically thought of as being the result of a join, then it's NOT in fifth normal form. 
	in many cases, once you get to third normal form you have fully normalized the database
	insertion, deletion, update anomolies

partitioning, sharding, and replication
	sharding: server
	partition: data
	you shard a database into multiple instances as needed
	you partition the data to flow equally through each shard, increasing the throughput of each db instance
	you can have multiple paritions of data flow through one server
	load balancing: moving paritions of data across shards to improve performance (if, for instance, one partition is getting a lot of requests and slowing down the performance of the other partitions in the shard, you can move the affected partitions to another shard)
