lists v tuples
	lists take up more memory, b/c they have added functionality
	tuples are immutable. they cannot be changed
	once you make a tuple, it is set in stone
	tuple containing one element without typing comma will just return the data type: ("a") = 'a', ("a",) = ("a")
	tuple assignment in python: 

sets
	useful when item order and frequency doesn't matter
	set can contain different data types
	in lists and tuples, the order matters. Doesnt matter in sets
	sets are mutable
	union and intersection of sets
		union: combo of all items in set. A u B denotes union
		intersection: A n B denotes intersection. only returns the elements A and B have in common

data types in python
	container sequences: hold other types of data
	mutable: lists, sets or immutable: sets
	combining lists: operators: +
	tuple unpacking: very powerful when working in loops. e.g. a list of tuples: for tup[0], tup[1] in tuple_list:
